Congratulations
=================
You've won a dlna implementation that doesn't suck.

Teh renderer
-----------------
./player/dlnarender advertises itself on your local network as renderer.
You can use an arbitrary dlna control thing to make it play stuff via the regular mplayer binary.


Gimme
=================

Requirements
-----------------
- some linux thing. Android works too.
- mplayer


Ritual of Compilation
---------------------
you need pythong-2.65.32-ubuntu6 then hand edit an unreadable perl script
that calls ruby to check if the size of int32 changed today.

just kidding. type make. doh.
